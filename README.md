# Usage

First clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/debryu/Autonomous-Software-Agents.git
```
Then move inside the folder and run
```bash
npm install
```
find the file  ```mainframe.js``` located in ```lib/deliverooClient/agent_folder/mainframe.js```
and in the same path from the terminal run
```bash
node mainframe.js "CHOOSE A NAME FOR THE AGENT" "TOKEN"
```
---

The token can be retrieved by connecting to https://deliveroojs.onrender.com/ and filling with the name of the agent when asked. 

You need to run two different agents otherwise the first one will just wait endlessly for the other.
